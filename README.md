# homeschooler
ThoughtWorks Shokunin Challenge July 2020

Solves the homeschool task allocation problem with simulated annealing. Run the [notebook](https://github.com/safetydave/homeschooler/blob/main/homeschooler.ipynb) to execute the solution and extensions.

Solution is stochastic but solves sample problem in median ~36 steps (is that fast?)

Sample results:

```
Yes
Child 1: Task D (2 points) + Task F (8 points) = 10 points
Child 2: Task E (7 points) + Task G (3 points) = 10 points
Child 3: Task A (5 points) + Task B (4 points) + Task C (1 points) = 10 points
```

Yet to meet other awesomeness criteria - sorry.

But bonus comparison of solution performance of different initial states and energy functions.
